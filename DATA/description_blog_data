S' The Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era.[1] Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as "Beatlemania", but as the group\'s music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s.\n'

aS' The Grammys had their origin in the Hollywood Walk of Fame project in the 1950s.[1][2] As the recording executives chosen for the Walk of Fame committee worked at compiling a list of important recording industry people who might qualify for a Walk of Fame star, they realized there were many more people who were leaders in their business who would never earn a star on Hollywood Boulevard. The music executives decided to rectify this by creating an award given by their industry similar to the Oscars and the Emmys.\n'

aS' Although brought up to follow his father\'s career path, Jagger "was always a singer" as he stated in According to the Rolling Stones. "I always sang as a child. I was one of those kids who just liked to sing. Some kids sing in choirs; others like to show off in front of the mirror. I was in the church choir and I also loved listening to singers on the radio--the BBC or Radio Luxembourg--or watching them on TV and in the movies."\n'

aS' The Eagles disbanded in July 1980 but reunited in 1994 for the album Hell Freezes Over, a mix of live and new studio tracks.

aS" Page wrote most of Led Zeppelin's music, particularly early in their career, while Plant generally supplied the lyrics. Jones' keyboard-based compositions later became central to the group's catalogue, which featured increasing experimentation. The latter half of their career saw a series of record-breaking tours that earned the group a reputation for excess and debauchery. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, their output and touring schedule were limited during the late 1970s, and the group disbanded following Bonham's death from alcohol-related asphyxia in 1980. In the decades that followed, the surviving members sporadically collaborated and participated in one-off Led Zeppelin reunions. The most successful of these was the 2007 Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert in London, with Jason Bonham taking his late father's place behind the drums.\n"

aS' Because of his songwriting, wild personality, performances, and the dramatic circumstances surrounding his life and death, he is regarded by critics and fans as one of the most iconic and influential frontmen in rock music history. In the latter part of the 20th century, he was one of the popular culture\'s most rebellious and oft-displayed icons, representing the generation gap and youth counterculture.[2] He was also well known for improvising spoken word poetry passages while the band played live. Morrison was ranked number 47 on Rolling Stone\'s list of the "100 Greatest Singers of All Time",[3] and number 22 on Classic Rock magazine\'s "50 Greatest Singers In Rock".[4] Ray Manzarek said Morrison "embodied hippie counterculture rebellion".[5] Morrison was sometimes referred to by other monikers, such as "Lizard King" and "King of Orgasmic Rock".[6]\n'

Best stated that "if the championship was decided on home games we would win it every season. This time our away games made the difference.

aS' In 1972 Ajax won a second European Cup, beating Internazionale 2\xe2\x80\x930 in the final, with Cruyff scoring both goals.[7] This victory prompted Dutch newspapers to announce the demise of the Italian style of defensive football in the face of Total Football. Soccer: The Ultimate Encyclopaedia says: "Single-handed, Cruyff not only pulled Internazionale of Italy apart in the 1972 European Cup Final, but scored both goals in Ajax\'s 2\xe2\x80\x930 win."[28] Cruyff also scored in the 3\xe2\x80\x932 victory over ADO Den Haag in the KNVB Cup final. In the league, Cruyff was the top scorer with 25 goals as Ajax became champions. Ajax won the Intercontinental Cup, beating Argentina\'s Independiente 1\xe2\x80\x931 in the first game followed by 3\xe2\x80\x930, and then in January 1973, they won the European Super Cup by beating Rangers 3\xe2\x80\x931 away and 3\xe2\x80\x932 in Amsterdam. Cruyff\'s only own goal came on 20 August 1972 against FC Amsterdam. A week later, against Go Ahead Eagles in a 6\xe2\x80\x930 win, Cruyff scored four times for Ajax. The 1972\xe2\x80\x9373 season was concluded with another league championship victory and a third successive European Cup with a 1\xe2\x80\x930 win over Juventus in the final, with the Encyclopedia stating Cruyff "inspired one of the greatest 20-minute spells of football ever seen."\n'

aS' An advanced playmaker who operated in the classic number 10 position, Maradona is the only player in football history to set the world record transfer fee twice, first when he transferred to Barcelona for a then world record \xc2\xa35 million, and second, when he transferred to Napoli for another record fee \xc2\xa36.9 million.[12] He played for Argentinos Juniors, Boca Juniors, Barcelona, Napoli, Sevilla and Newell\'s Old Boys during his club career, and is most famous for his time at Napoli where he won numerous accolades. In his international career with Argentina, he earned 91 caps and scored 34 goals. Maradona\'s exceptional vision, passing, ball control, dribbling skills, speed, reflexes and thinking time was combined with his small size (he was 5\'5", or 1.65m) giving him a low center of gravity which allowed him to be more maneuverable than most other football players; he would often dribble past multiple opposing players on a run. His presence on the pitch had a great effect on his team\'s general performance, while he would often be singled out by the opposition. A precocious talent, Maradona was given the nickname "El Pibe de Oro" ("The Golden Boy"), a name that stuck with him throughout his career.[13]\n'
