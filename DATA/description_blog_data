S' "The true burden of congenital disease with Zika virus is probably underestimated," said Dr. Marco Safadi of the Santa Casa Medical School in Sao Paulo, Brazil, who\'s been treating and studying cases.\n'
p1
aS' The man, from the San Juan area, fell ill with the Zika virus and experienced symptoms including fever, rash and joint pain. After recovering from the Zika symptoms, the man then developed immune thrombocytopenic purpura, or ITP, an autoimmune disorder that has been linked to the virus. The bleeding disorder that killed him was as a side-effect of the ITP.\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough Zika virus\xe2\x80\x93associated deaths are rare, the first identified death in Puerto Rico highlights the possibility of severe cases, as well as the need for continued outreach to raise health care providers\xe2\x80\x99 awareness of complications that might lead to severe disease or death,\xe2\x80\x9d reports the CDC in its findings.\n'
p2
aS' A Puerto Rican man in his 70s who died from complications of the Zika virus was the first case of his kind in the U.S., The New York Times first reported on Friday.The man\xe2\x80\x99s case was one of 683 confirmed Zika infections in Puerto Rico, according to the Centers for Disease Control. The outbreak includes 89 pregnant women.\n'
p3
aS" Florida has been identified as one of the most likely places for the disease to gain a foothold, and, with no treatments for zika available, regulators have provisionally approved the release of GM mosquitoes.Derric Nimmo, a bioscientist with Oxitec, an Oxford University spin-out company, told the Sunday Times: 'We would expect to release about 3.3million mosquitoes over nine months \xe2\x80\x93 just over 200,000 a week.\n"
p4
aS' Speaking to the Caribbean Media Corporation (CMC) on the sidelines of the meeting, Jamaica\xe2\x80\x99s Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade Minister Kamina Johnson-Smith said the fight against Zika is important to the Caribbean region not just because of its impact on the tourism industry, but also the health problems that might not be obvious immediate.\n'
p5
aS" The victim had a condition called thrombocytopenia \xe2\x80\x94 low platelet count that can result in bleeding. Sharp said it's a rare but known complication of Zika and not a sign that the virus is causing worse symptoms than expected.Zika's spreading fast across Latin America and the Caribbean. The U.S. territory of Puerto Rico's been hit hard, too.\n"
p6
aS' There have been 18 confirmed cases of the mosquito-borne virus in the state this year, but all have been contracted overseas.Federal Health Minister Susan Ley said the money had been approved this week and was on top of what would be included in Tuesday\'s budget."The money will assist existing and ongoing surveillance at Cairns and Townsville airports," Ms Ley said.\n'
p7
aS' If that holds together and nothing else gets added, it\xe2\x80\x99s basically the best pay-per-view lineup of the year so far, right? But has the arbitrary enormity of the round number attached to this event blinded us to that? And did what we shall now refer to as The Conor McGregor Situation only further distort our sense of what is actually being offered here?\n'
p8
aS' Conor McGregor is not giving up on his mission to fight at UFC 200 just yet. Despite UFC president Dana White vehemently saying McGregor will not fight on the card after refusing to attend the press tour for the event, McGregor is once again on social media campaigning to get back on the card and get his revenge on Nate Diaz.\n'
p9
aS' After a main event change saw featherweight champion Conor McGregor pulled from his scheduled rematch with Nate Diaz and replaced by the long-awaited grudge match between 205-pound champion Daniel Cormier and ex-titleholder Jon Jones, it appears as if UFC 200 is mostly set in stone \xe2\x80\x93 or at least the top half of the main card is.\n'
p10
aS' \xe2\x80\x9c(The interim belt) is the No. 1 contender belt, that\xe2\x80\x99s what they should call it,\xe2\x80\x9d Edgar said in New York. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I have a feeling Conor is never coming back down to 145 pounds, so in time it will be the real belt. I think he knows the risk of possibly losing (the featherweight title).\xe2\x80\x9d\n'
p11
aS' Penciled in for a bid to avenge his March loss to Nate Diaz at UFC 200, expected to be the biggest money show in UFC history, McGregor stunned MMA fans with an April 19 tweet announcing his retirement: \xe2\x80\x9cI have decided to retire young. Thanks for the cheese. Catch ya\xe2\x80\x99s later.\xe2\x80\x9d\n'
p12
aS' In case you\xe2\x80\x99ve been living under a rock, McGregor and the UFC have been going back-and-forth for almost two weeks. It began with McGregor retiring and no-showing at a UFC commercial shoot, claiming that media obligations were interfering with training despite the shoot and press tour being three months before his rematch with Diaz.\n'
p13
aS' With just 53 days to go, this conventional wisdom is starting to look naive. That is partly because Mr. Cameron may yet be heading for defeat, despite scoring several points in the past couple of weeks. Though a series of recent heavyweight independent analyses have predicted a British exit, or Brexit, would have a negative long-term impact on the U.K. economy, and President Barack Obama warned a post-Brexit U.K. shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect any quick U.S.-U.K. trade deal, the polls suggest the vote remains on a knife-edge. The latest poll of polls, which averages the six most recent polls, shows the Remain campaign ahead by 51% to 49%, according to whatukthinks.org. That is too tight for comfort for the Remain camp since Brexit supporters, who tend to be older, are thought much more likely to vote than younger Britons.\n'
p14
aS' Slightly more Britons want to leave the European Union than want to stay, according to an ICM poll for the Sun on Sunday taken after U.S. President Barack Obama\'s warning that Britain would go to the "back of queue" in striking trade deals after Brexit.\n'
p15
aS' And Ukip leader Nigel Farage said the poll showed it was now even more likely that David Cameron will be ousted as Prime Minister after the referendum vote on June 23 because of outrage at the scare tactics being used in the campaign. \n'

aS' This is precisely what happened in the UK last week. President Obama flew down to London, lunched merrily with the Queen, presented a lovely wooden rocking horse to the young Prince George and then lectured Britons on what was good for them, because it was in his national interest.\n'

p21
aS' It\xe2\x80\x99s such an unusual case, hitting one family. All victims were part of the Rhoden family.Seven of those killed were adults. One was a 16-year-old.

aS" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported the first Zika-virus-related death in the United States, a Puerto Rican man in his 70s who died in late February.The man died from internal bleeding resulting from a rare immune reaction to his Zika infection. The agency issued a report Friday on the growing Zika transmission in Puerto Rico. It said the patient died after developing severe thrombocytopenia, or low levels of platelets that help blood clot. The report provided no details.In an interview, Tyler Sharp, acting chief epidemiologist at CDC's Dengue Branch in San Juan, Puerto Rico, said the man had a rare autoimmune condition that has been linked to Zika virus infections in other countries hit by the epidemic. The condition, known as ITP, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, has also been associated with other infectious diseases, Sharp said.\n"
